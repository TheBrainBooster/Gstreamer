# Gstreamer

Welcome to the Gstreamer project!

Gstreamer (aka Ghost streamer) is an emergency toolbox for Android phones.

Requirements:
Windows 7
.net framework 4.0

the software is aimed to help you to get informations and troubleshooting your phone,
but it's also an interesting way to have a deeper knowledgeof your phone and what's 
actually happening inside it ;)
It should work even if your phone has the lcd screen or the touch digitizer broken
just try! 
works better on rooted deices
don't forget to enable the ADB usb debug! :D
