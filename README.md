# Gstreamer

Welcome to the Gstreamer project!

Gstreamer (aka Ghost streamer) is an emergency toolbox for Android phones.

Requirements:
Windows 7
.net framework 4.0
a little bit of knowledge 
a lot of patience (always needed with broken devices)
usb debug enabled
By default, USB debugging is disabled with stock ROMs (some custom ROMs however have it enabled by default). 
To toggle it on or off, you can find the corresponding switch in 
Settings › Development – a section originally hidden with Android 4.2 and up.
You can make this section visible by going to
Settings › About device and "tapping" the entry telling your ROM's build version until
a toast-message congratulates you for having become a developer.

The software is aimed to help you to get informations and troubleshooting your phone,
but it's also an interesting way to have a deeper knowledge of your phone and what's 
actually happening inside it ;)
It should work even if your phone has the lcd screen or the touch digitizer broken
just try! 
works better on rooted deices
don't forget to enable the ADB usb debug! :D
